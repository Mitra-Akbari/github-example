    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Davisville (Downtown Toronto) has the most number of italian restaurants in Toronto. New Toronto (Etobicoke), St. James Town(Downtown Toronto), Little Portugal (West Toronto) are some of the best neighborhoods for Italian cuisine in Toronto. Downtown Toronto have potential Italian Resturant Market, there are multiple neighborhoods in Downtown Toronto with average ratings exceeding 8.1. East Park ranks last in average rating (0 from 10) of Italian restaurants. It might be as a result of limitation of data providing only by Foursquare. In addition, I would go to Terroni in Downtown Toronto for the best Italian food based on 278 likes and Rating of 8.1. Downtown Toronto and West Toronto are the best place to stay if you prefer Italian Cuisine."
